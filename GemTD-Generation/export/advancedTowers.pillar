! Advanced towersNote: The towers are displayed based on fan-provided order. Hence, updates may break temporarily (until manual update) the order. To solve this problem, unordered towers are displayed at the bottom in the Others section. The Other section also includes experimental towers not necessarily available in-game (Currently there is a super emerald golem for example).! Combined towers!!
